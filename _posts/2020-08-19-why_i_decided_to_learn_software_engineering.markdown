After working 9 years as a Registered nurse, I realize that although it has been a wonderful and challenging experience, I am not passionate about it and I don’t feel fulfilled in this career. It is rewarding knowing how many people I have helped but I am constantly “burnt out”, I am not able to enjoy time with my family, and everyday it feels like a battle zone going into a job where it is difficult to efficiently complete my job and working with difficult personalities. Not to mention that I don’t feel mentally stimulated.

One day I sat down and thought about what could be something that I would really enjoy doing and turning it into a career. I then thought about when I was in high school and took a computer class where I learned HTML and CSS. I would take that knowledge and create my own MySpace page and create my friends pages as well, and I remembered how much I enjoyed it.

I then started to do some research on coding, and the more I researched, the more I fell in love. The high job satisfaction, the kinds of people you get to work with, and the fact that you don’t need to have a 4 year degree. I first came across freecodecamp. It’s a very good resource for complete beginners. I have found so many free resources online and after teaching myself some basics, I finally decided I was ready to join a coding bootcamp and finally make the career change that I’ve been wanting.
